# Grading

Students will be assessed on 4 assignments (50% of grade) and a final
exam (50% of grade).

Assignments may be submitted as an knitr, LaTeX, Markdown or MultiMarkdown file (other formats by request). The instructor should be able to compile an HTML or PDF output file from the submitted source file. **Assignments submitted in word processor file formats, including Microsoft Word, will not be accepted**. Hand-written assignments (including scanned documents) are also not permitted. Students will be
introduced to valid document formats at the beginning of the course.

All assignments will be submitted electronically, via students' private GitHub repositories. Instructions on how to set up and use GitHub accounts will be provided.

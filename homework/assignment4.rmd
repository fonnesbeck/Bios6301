$5^{n=day}$ points taken off for each day late.

This assigment includes turning in the first three assignments. All three should
include knitr files (named `homework1.rmd`, `homework2.rmd`, `homework3.rmd`, `homework4.rmd`)
along with valid PDF output files. Inside each file, clearly indicate which
parts of your responses go with which problems (you may use the original homework
document as a template). Add your name as `author` to the file's metadata section.
Raw R code/output or word processor files are not acceptable.

Failure to properly name files or include author name may result in 5 points taken off.
